;; MC-STM: meta-circular STM in Clojure
;; Multicore Programming
;; (c) 2011-2013, Tom Van Cutsem

;; version 4 - MVCC with fine-grained locking and support for commute
;; Improvements over v3:
;; - no more single global commit-lock for all transactions
;;   Instead uses fine-grained locking (one lock / ref)
